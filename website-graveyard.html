      <h3>january 2, 2026</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since I had to make a Wix site in eighth grade art class, I've been
        obsessed with my online portfolio. I check on it relentlessly—as if it
        would explode the second I looked away—and update it constantly. The
        website preoccupation started as a preteenaged act of self-expression, a
        claiming stake on my own existence in an environment where I felt
        invisible. As I grew up, the website evolved into a representation of my
        career.
        <br /><br />
        Here I present to you a deeply embarrassing chronicle of almost every
        website I've ever built, starting from (oh god) ten years ago, in the
        hopes that it will bring you inspiration and/or entertainment.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

      <h3>chapter one: eighth grade</h3>

      <p>
        In eighth grade, we were given the option to take one single honors
        course: Honors Art Foundations. It was the perfect course; it appealed
        to both my chronic overachiever sensibilities and my burgeoning interest
        in art. In order to apply for Honors Art Foundations, we had to submit a
        portfolio of work. That initial portfolio was the first time I ever took
        drawing seriously. I still remember the day I got the acceptance letter
        in the mail, and I immediately dialed up my best friend on the landline
        to confirm she also got in.<br /><br />
        The class ended up being ridiculously rigorous. Every week we had to
        submit an assignment that I averaged eight hours working on, and I was
        determined to be the best artist in the class (much to my everlasting
        despair, I never was). To this day it was the most difficult class I've
        ever taken, constantly imbuing me with dread, mortification, and
        bitterness. It's also the reason I became a designer.<br /><br /><br /><br />

      <h3>chapter two: high school</h3>
      <img src="images/site-2.png" /><br /><br />
      <img src="images/site-2-2.png" /><br />
      <p>
        I'm being very brave in sharing the artist statement here, which I
        unfortunately had elected to display on the home page at the time. Hello
        Hyacinths was an artist name I adopted in high school because I had made
        an Instagram account for my art and I wanted a more
        professional-sounding tag than biancas_art. I was very fortunate to be
        gifted an iPad Pro in high school, where I became immediately taken with
        Procreate and digital drawing. Much like middle school, I remember this
        era as one of constant self-comparison, but instead of my classmates I
        was then comparing my art to professionals online.<br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>chapter three: college</h3>
      <img src="images/site-3.png" /><br /><br />
      <img src="images/site-3-2.png" /><br />
      <p>
        Near the end of high school I rebranded to Bombylls, because I saw
        <a
          href="https://ia801307.us.archive.org/0/items/cu31924027421712/cu31924027421712.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          >this version</a
        >
        of the word bumblebee as bombyll bee and found it very charming. This
        was also around the time I came out as nonbinary and started going by
        Bee.<br /><br />
        Anyways, this site came around during my freshman year of college, as
        you can see by the technical drawings from my foundation year studio
        classes. The goofy guy in glasses is my partner
        <a href="https://organzola.games" target="_blank">Drew Shapiro</a>.
        Also, that email address is defunct. Please do not email it.<br /><br /><br /><br />

      <h3>chapter four: the carrd era</h3>
      <img src="images/site-4.png" /><br /><br />
      <img src="images/site-4-2.png" /><br />
      <p>
        Junior year of college I decided to buy a domain, and switched from Wix
        to Carrd because the paid plan was much cheaper. I hardly remember the
        Wix interface anymore but I remember feeling frustrated by Carrd's
        comparative limitations. If only there were an affordable way to gain
        total control over my site...<br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>chapter five: bee finally learns html</h3>
      <img src="images/site-5.png" /><br />
      <p>
        One winter break, it was time. I taught myself HTML and CSS with the
        help of
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> and
        made a website using Github Pages. Shout out to
        <a href="https://everest-pipkin.com/" target="_blank">Everest Pipkin</a>
        for answering my silly coding questions and being my inspiration!
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

      <h3>chapter six: the first overhaul</h3>
      <img src="images/site-6.png" /><br /><br />
      <img src="images/site-6-2.png" /><br />
      <p>
        This site design was made in response to feedback that my portfolio
        wasn't professional-looking enough. I don't like the branding now but
        looking back it was nice that I had process pages for my games. Maybe
        I'll bring those back sometime.<br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>chapter seven: the second overhaul</h3>
      <img src="images/site-7.png" /><br /><br />
      <img src="images/site-7-2.png" /><br />
      <p>
        The thing about having complete creative freedom unbound by the
        restrictions of a website builder is that I get a little compulsive. I
        was going for something with more personality this time around, but it's
        giving whimsical storybook in a way that doesn't really represent my
        work.<br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>chapter eight: career</h3>
      <img src="images/site-8.png" /><br />
      <p>
        A few months after I graduated, I was hired as an editorial intern at
        Paste Games, which I found out upon starting was being rebranded as a
        new site called Endless Mode. I made this site to commemorate my new
        career as a games journalist. I still think it's cute, but it wasn't
        modular enough for the amount of articles I was producing.<br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>chapter nine: times new roman</h3>
      <img src="images/site-9.png" /><br /><br />
      <img src="images/site-9-2.png" /><br />
      <p>
        I get depressed during the winter, which you can tell because this year
        I became briefly obsessed with Times New Roman. I figured there were
        simply too many fonts out there, and this one was pre-installed on every
        computer; I didn't even need to download it to my site files. I was also
        trying to get a more modular structure going on. Thus spawned the most
        boring site design yet, though I really adored it for a while.<br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <h3>chapter ten: present day</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not gonna take a screenshot of the current website because you're on
        it! I'm very proud of it. It was my quickest turnaround yet—it only took
        two days from start to launch—and I think it's the best design so far. I
        wanted an archive of every article I've ever written, because a lot of
        them unfortunately vanished from my author page when Endless Mode
        transitioned to A.V. Club Games. <br /><br />I chose Courier because
        it's one of the pre-installed fonts on every device, and because it
        simultaneously evokes typewriters and programming terminals, which I
        feel represents my work quite neatly.<br /><br />
        Thank you for reading all the way to the end of this! I hope you got
        some entertainment out of my decade-long pursuit of the perfect website.
        I'm trying to kick my perfectionistic tendencies because they're
        paralyzing my design process, so publically displaying some of my most
        embarrassing work is, like, creatively necessary. Also it's cool to see
        how far I've come.<br /><br />
        If you're interested in building your first website with HTML and CSS,
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> is a
        great resource to get started.
        <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a> is all at
        once a source of inspiration, a hosting site (though I use Github Pages
        because it has free custom domain hosting) and a lovely community. I'm
