        Serving 600,000 commuters a day, New York City’s Penn Station is

          >the busiest transit hub</a
        >
        in the entire Western Hemisphere. Following the demolition of McKim,
        Mead, & White’s original lofty Beaux-Arts stronghold in 1964, Penn
        Station was pushed below ground in a claustrophobic, poorly-lit series
        of labyrinthine tunnels designed to serve only a third of its daily
        occupants.
        <br /><br />
        The first balm to this architectural affront, Moynihan Train Hall, is a
        $1.6 billion civic project that adaptively reuses the mail-sorting hall
        of the James A. Farley Building, which formerly acted as the main branch
        of the USPS, and now serves Amtrak and Long Island Rail Road passengers.
        While it is no restoration of the original Penn Station, nor does it
        solve the many issues plaguing our modern station, Moynihan Train Hall
        is a fantastic head house that makes Penn significantly less unbearable
        to be in.<br /><br />
        The new train hall was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (<a
          href="https://www.som.com/projects/moynihan-train-hall/"
          target="_blank"
          >SOM</a
        >) and construction began in 2010. Having opened its doors on New Years’
        Day in 2021, Moynihan Train Hall reinstates the original Penn Station’s
        airy ambiance with 92-foot-tall glass skylights supported by the old
        Farley Building’s steel trusses (a previously invisible architectural
        element that has become an iconic feature of the modern train hall’s
        design) and crowned with a towering 12-foot Art Deco clock. Moynihan
        boasts energy-efficient engineering in the form of LED lighting,
        mechanical air filtration systems, and multi-zone heating and cooling
        slab systems that only condition foot-trafficked areas. It is a feat of
        civic engineering and our city needs more projects like it.<br /><br />
        I work at a coffee shop in Moynihan, and being in the main concourse
        every day for hours on end does nothing to dull its magnificence. The
        marble floors shine pearlescent in the sunlight, the steel trusses rise
        like titans overhead, and the food hall has some pretty decent
        selections on your lunch break. <br /><br />
        There’s just one problem.<br /><br />
        The Splash Lab (<a
          href="https://thesplashlabusa.com/Project.dmx?itemnum=moynihan-train-hall"
          target="_blank"
          >TSL</a
        >) is a washroom design company that was founded in 2017 by brothers
        Justin and Fraser Lovell with the stated goal of creating sustainable,
        modular bathroom systems. Their Ribbon collection is a stainless
        steel-cast set of minimalist soap dispensers, faucets, and air dryers.
        Designed by Sebastian Conran, the Ribbon collection received the Chicago
        Athenaeum Museum Good Design Award for Bath + Accessories in 2015. It is
        the worst handwashing station I have ever had the displeasure of
        using.<br /><br />
        The Moynihan Train Hall public restrooms feature the full three-fixture
        set from TSL’s Ribbon collection mounted on their Monolith basin sinks.
        Each Ribbon fixture is progressively larger in size than the one before
        it, with the soap dispenser being the smallest and the air dryer the
        largest. The primary problem with the design, which I cannot fathom
        being overlooked in the very first round of prototyping, is that the
        fixtures are crammed too close together. At best you can fit one hand
        underneath any given fixture without triggering another sensor. This is
        cramped but reasonable enough for the soap dispenser, but quickly
        becomes an insurmountable problem when you need to run both of your
        hands under the faucet.<br /><br />
        Let me start with the low-hanging fruit: the automatic soap dispensers
        never have any soap in them, accompanied always by a plastic bottle of
        the bluest, wateriest soap you’ve ever used (the “luxury experience” TSL
        so frequently boasts creating is utterly lost when the hand soap isn’t
        foamy). Furthermore, the waterflow is downright horrific: the stream is
        hardly one centimeter in diameter on a good day, and the pressure is
        abysmally weak. It takes an additional thirty seconds just to get all
        the suds off your hands, and requires an elaborate and humiliating
        dance.<br /><br />
        But the biggest offense of all is that, due to the fixtures being too
        close together, if you run your hands under the faucet and attempt to
        wash your hands as you would at any normal sink, you will inevitably
        trigger the automatic sensor for the hand dryer. And, as you can
        imagine, a running hand dryer directly next to a running stream of water
        results in that stream of water spraying everywhere. Ironically, the
        water pressure is so low it doesn’t end up being that catastrophic, but
        the fact that this is a regular occurrence on
        <i>an award-winning washroom system</i> is incomprehensible to me.<br /><br />

        As Don Norman writes in <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>, “It is the
        duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is
        not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of
        machines.” The problem with the restroom designers and even the
        designers of the entire train hall is that they are not engaging in
        human-centered design. The designs for both Moynihan Train Hall and the
        Ribbon washroom collection are based primarily on cost efficiency: how
        do we spend the least possible amount of money on maintenance, including
        lighting, air conditioning, soap, and water usage. Yes, these efforts
        are environmentally sustainable, but I doubt they would be so eagerly
        integrated (and widely boasted) if they were more expensive than the
        alternative in the long-run. <br /><br />
        The only seating in Moynihan Train Hall is in the tiny, ticketed waiting
        area off to the far side of the massive hall and always packed to the
        brim; every day I see dozens of people sitting on the floor, their backs
        propped against the pillars as they wait for their (absurdly expensive)
        trains. Mystifyingly, there is not a single public-use garbage can in
        the entire 255,000 square foot hall; you either have to catch a
        sanitation worker on their walk-through or ask one of the shops if you
        can use theirs.
        <br /><br />
        The minor tediums and frustrations that arise from these massive design
        oversights compound exponentially for daily commuters and train hall
        staff. This is what happens when you design for awards, funding, and
        prestige, rather than the people who will actually use your creations,
        and it’s a disgrace to the craft.
